# Expense Splitter App

This repository contains the initial setup for an Expense Splitter application.

The backend is written in Go using Gin and PostgreSQL, with a clean project structure to support future features such as user management, expense tracking, and split calculations.  
A frontend folder is also included for future UI development.

This commit focuses on setting up the base project structure and development environment.
